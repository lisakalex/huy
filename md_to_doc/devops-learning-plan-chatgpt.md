  - Process management (`ps`, `top`, `kill`)
  - Permissions and ownership (`chmod`, `chown`)
  
- **System Administration**:
  - Users and groups management
  - Package management (`apt`, `yum`, `rpm`)
  - Networking basics (IP configuration, `ping`, `netstat`, `curl`)
  
- **Filesystems and Disk Management**:

  - Disk partitioning and formatting (`fdisk`, `mkfs`)
  
- **Networking and Security**:
  - SSH setup and key management
  - Firewall basics (`ufw`, `iptables`)

### Hands-on Practice:
- Set up a **Linux VM** (using VirtualBox or Docker).
- Perform regular tasks like creating users, modifying file permissions, and configuring basic networking.

## **Phase 2: Shell Scripting (1-2 weeks)**

**Objective**: Automate repetitive tasks and build simple workflows using shell scripts.

### Key Learning Areas:
- **Basic Scripting**:
  - Writing simple shell scripts
  - Using variables and environment variables
  - Control structures (if-else, loops)

- **Automation**:
  - Writing scripts to automate common system tasks
  - Scheduling tasks using `cron`
  
- **Advanced Scripting**:
  - Functions and debugging scripts
  - Handling errors and logging

### Hands-on Practice:
- Create a script that automates server setup (e.g., install packages, create users, configure firewall).
- Write scripts to back up data or log files from a server.

## **Phase 3: Python for DevOps (2-3 weeks)**

**Objective**: Build automation scripts and applications in Python.

### Key Learning Areas:
- **Python Basics**:
  - Variables, data types, and operators
  - Control structures and loops
  - Functions, modules, and exception handling
  
- **File I/O and OS module**:
  - Reading from and writing to files
  - Using the `os` and `subprocess` modules for system interactions
  
- **Working with APIs**:
  - Using `requests` to interact with REST APIs
  - Automating data retrieval from APIs

### Hands-on Practice:
- Write a Python script to automate server monitoring (CPU, memory, disk usage).
- Use Python to interact with a cloud provider’s API (AWS, Azure, etc.).

## **Phase 4: Jenkins for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) (2-3 weeks)**

**Objective**: Learn how to automate build, test, and deployment pipelines using Jenkins.

### Key Learning Areas:
- **Introduction to Jenkins**:
  - Jenkins installation and setup
  - Overview of jobs, pipelines, and the Jenkins architecture
  
- **Creating CI/CD Pipelines**:
  - Freestyle jobs vs. pipeline jobs
  - Using Jenkins pipelines (Declarative and Scripted pipelines)
  - Automating builds and deployments

- **Integration with Version Control Systems**:
  - Setting up Jenkins with Git for automated builds
  - Triggering jobs from GitHub/GitLab

- **Plugins and Integrations**:
  - Configuring Jenkins plugins for extended functionality (e.g., Slack notifications)
  - Integrating Jenkins with Docker for containerized builds

### Hands-on Practice:
- Set up a Jenkins server on a Linux VM.
- Build a simple CI pipeline to pull code from GitHub, run tests, and deploy to a staging environment.

### Resources:
- [Jenkins Documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/)
- [Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Tutorials](https://www.udemy.com/course/jenkins-pipelines-step-by-step/)

## **Phase 5: Ansible for Configuration Management and Automation (2-3 weeks)**

**Objective**: Automate infrastructure provisioning, configuration, and orchestration using Ansible.

### Key Learning Areas:
- **Ansible Basics**:
  - Introduction to Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
  - Installing and configuring Ansible
  - Writing Playbooks and understanding YAML syntax
  
- **Inventory and Modules**:
  - Creating static and dynamic inventories
  - Using Ansible modules to perform tasks (package installation, service management, etc.)
  
- **Roles and Best Practices**:
  - Structuring playbooks with roles for reusability
  - Ansible Galaxy and community roles
  
- **Ansible Vault**:
  - Securing sensitive data using Ansible Vault
  
- **Advanced Ansible**:
  - Writing custom modules
  - Creating playbooks for cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure)

### Hands-on Practice:
- Create Ansible playbooks to configure multiple Linux servers (e.g., set up web servers, database servers).
- Use Ansible to deploy a sample application to a cluster of VMs.

### Resources:
- [Ansible Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html)
- [Ansible for DevOps](https://www.ansiblefordevops.com/)

## **Phase 6: DevOps Projects (4-6 weeks)**

**Objective**: Combine your knowledge of Linux, Jenkins, Ansible, Python, and shell scripting into real-world projects.

### Projects:
1. **Automated Server Setup**:
   - Use Ansible and Shell scripting to automate the provisioning of servers (install software, configure services).
   
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Set up a Jenkins pipeline to automate building, testing, and deploying a Python or Java web application.
   
3. **Infrastructure Monitoring**:
   - Build a monitoring solution using Python (or a pre-built tool like Nagios) that sends alerts when servers/resources exceed certain thresholds.
   
4. **Multi-cloud Deployment**:
   - Write Ansible playbooks that can provision infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms (AWS, Azure) and deploy an application.
