#### Phase 1: Mastering Linux Fundamentals

**Objective:**
Understand the basics of Linux, including command-line operations, system architecture, file systems, and user management.

**Topics to Cover:**
- Overview of Linux distributions
- Command line basics (file manipulation, permissions, processes)
- System navigation and package management (apt, yum)
- Networking concepts and tools (ping, netstat, ifconfig)
- Logs and monitoring (checking logs and using `top`, `htop`, `ps`)

**Resources:**
- Books: "The Linux Command Line" by William Shotts
- Online Courses: 
    - Linux Foundation's Introduction to Linux (edX)
    - Udemy - Linux Mastery: Master Linux Administration

**Hands-On Practice:**
- Set up a Linux virtual machine (using VirtualBox or a cloud provider).
- Complete basic file manipulation tasks using the command line.
- Explore different Linux distributions and their features.

#### Phase 2: Continuous Integration with Jenkins

**Objective:**
Learn to set up and manage CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins.

**Topics to Cover:**
- Introduction to Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Installing Jenkins and configuring basic settings
- Creating and managing Jenkins jobs
- Integrating version control systems (Git) with Jenkins
- Jenkins pipelines: Declarative vs. Scripted pipelines
- Plugins and their role (GitHub, Docker, Ansible, etc.)

**Resources:**
- Books: "Learning Continuous Integration with Jenkins" by Nikhil Pathak
- Online Courses: 
    - Coursera – Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery with Jenkins
    - Udemy – Jenkins, From Zero To Hero: Become a DevOps Jenkins Master

**Hands-On Practice:**
- Create multiple basic Jenkins pipelines.
- Integrate a GitHub repository with Jenkins and automate build processes.
- Experiment with different Jenkins plugins and functionality.

#### Phase 3: Configuration Management with Ansible

**Objective:**
Gain proficiency in using Ansible for automation and configuration management.

**Topics to Cover:**
- Introduction to configuration management and automation
- Installing and configuring Ansible
- Writing playbooks and roles
- Inventory management
- Modules and tasks in Ansible
- Using Ansible for orchestration (multi-tier deployments)

**Resources:**
- Books: "Ansible for DevOps" by Jeff Geerling
- Online Courses: 
    - Udemy – Mastering Ansible
    - Pluralsight – Ansible: Getting Started

**Hands-On Practice:**
- Write simple Ansible playbooks for deploying applications.
- Use Ansible to configure a web server (Apache or Nginx).
- Create roles for reusable Ansible code.

#### Phase 4: Scripting Skills - Python and Shell

**Objective:**
Develop scripting skills to automate tasks and integrate with other tools.

**Topics to Cover:**
- Shell scripting basics (Bash)
- File handling and text processing in shell scripts
- Writing functions and using control structures
- Introduction to Python for automation
- Python libraries for system automation (os, subprocess, etc.)

**Resources:**
- Books: 
    - "Learning Python" by Mark Lutz
    - "Bash Cookbook" by Carl Albing, JP Vossen, and Cameron Newham
- Online Courses: 
    - Codecademy - Learn Python 3
    - Udemy – Shell Scripting: Discover How to Automate Command Line Tasks

**Hands-On Practice:**
- Write shell scripts for routine tasks (backup, monitoring system status).
- Create Python scripts to automate interaction with APIs or file manipulation.
- Work on a small project combining Python, Shell scripting, and Ansible.

---

#### Phase 5: Putting it All Together (Capstone Project)

**Objective:**
Integrate all learned skills into a full DevOps workflow/project.

**Project Idea:**
Build a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins that:
1. Pulls code from a GitHub repository.
2. Uses Ansible for configuration management and deployment.
3. Implements a shell or Python script to automate a specific task (like preparing the environment or running tests).

**Resources:**
- Documentation for Jenkins, Ansible, Python, and Shell.
- Online forums like Stack Overflow or specific technology communities.

**Hands-On Practice:**
- Document the project process, including system architecture and workflows.
- Test the pipeline thoroughly and troubleshoot issues.
- Present and share your project on platforms like GitHub.

### Additional Tips for Success
1. **Join Communities:** Participate in DevOps forums, local meetups, or online communities (like Reddit, DevOps Subreddits, or Stack Overflow).
2. **Stay Updated:** Follow relevant blogs, podcasts, and YouTube channels (like DevOps on YouTube) to keep up with new tools and practices.
3. **Practice Regularly:** Consistent, hands-on practice is crucial for mastery. Consider contributing to open-source projects to implement your skills.

By following this learning plan, you will build a strong foundation and become proficient in essential DevOps tools and practices. Good luck on your DevOps journey!
